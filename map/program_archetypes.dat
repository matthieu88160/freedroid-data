#Potential future implementation# Nethack = takeover for humans. Possibly with a new minigame where you somehow make the human get sucked into playing the game turning it to a somewhat stupid bot, freezing them in place and agreeing to do things for you (eg like Tybalt will open the gate to RG house and let you past even if you are not yet a member). This would open up a lot of options for creating alternative storylines (eg never becoming an RG member).
