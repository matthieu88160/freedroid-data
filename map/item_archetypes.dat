Of course this makes them a bit less elegant and also less comfy to wear, but the extra protection might be worth it, at less than the price of hiking boots."

*Item description text=_"These hiking boots are a very sophisticated product, combining optimal comfort for the wearer with a good protection from collisions with blunt objects like stones, which of course also makes for a higher price."
