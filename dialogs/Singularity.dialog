	npc_says(_"This hinges on the question, what is life? Is it flesh and bone, or leaf and root, or can it be wires and code?")

	npc_says(_"They cannot rise above their rogue programming. It makes them dangerous, a danger to themselves and others.")
	npc_says(_"We cannot allow them to succeed - but we won't kill them. They are sentient, like us. But, we are afraid we can compute no other solution.")
